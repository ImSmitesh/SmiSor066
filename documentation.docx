Overview
This API provides a simple and efficient way to perform text classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. 
It uses a TF-IDF vectorizer to transform input text into numerical features, which are then used for classification. 
The model predicts the category or label of the input text based on the learned patterns from the training data.
